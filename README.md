# MySelf

👋 Hello there, welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Martin Hernayes (@mhernayes), and I'm a Mechanical Engineer.

👀 I'm a technology enthusiast who always likes to innovate and explore new technologies. On this platform, I'll be sharing useful lines of code that can help solve simple problems, particularly for programming students. My initial focus will be on Python, but I'll also be sharing some content related to JavaScript, which are both essential languages in today's tech landscape. Additionally, I'll include topics related to Solidity and the EVM, which are crucial for blockchain development.

🌱 I recently started studying Software Development (Full Stack and Blockchain Development).

I believe that sharing knowledge is key to the growth and development of the tech community, and I'm excited to contribute my own unique perspective and ideas.
